 *Project Description: This project is called 'Bank Risk Analysis' which takes input from the user about 
 *					   the bank's details such as number of banks, the limit of these banks and which bank has
 *					   borrowed a certain amount of loan from a specific bank. The program's purpose is to 
 *					   find out which bank is unsafe by comparing the total asset of a bank with the limit 
 *					   provided by the user.
 *
 *Start Date: 		   15th February, 2024
 *End Date:            14th March, 2024 //3
